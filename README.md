# SmartMine

SmartMine allows you to mine 16 different cryptocurrencies directly (with support for more coins coming). Mining coins this way has consistently higher profitability over selling your hashing power with other similar services. Head over to [WhatToMine](https://whattomine.com) and enter your hardware to see how much you would be making.


*Why do we stand out?*


SmartMine is able to identify problems such as lower hash rates than expected, and take the steps necessary to fix them. It does this by checking if the miner is an active process on the GPU, taking into account GPU power consumption and current hash rate, and then restarting the miner if required. This way, you'll have close to no down time on your mining.

### Features:
- SmartMine switches to the most profitable coin automatically
- You can choose any pool to mine into
- SmartMine detects when the mining has stopped for whatever reason, and restarts it
- Profitability statisitics are displayed in a selection of many fiat currencies
- Comparatively low 2% fee (more details below)
- GPU temperatures, power consumption etc. are displayed
- Average hash rates for all mined algorithms are displayed
- Detailed logging and analysis of all mining related data

### Features still to come:
- Benchmark mode
- Estimated rewards obtained for each coin
- Estimates of total power consumption over time
- And many, many more :)

Supported cryptocurrencies: DCR, DGB, DMD, ETH, ETC, FTC, GRS, HUSH, KMD, LBC, MONA, SIB, SIGT, ZCL, ZEC and ZEN

As of right now, there's a 2% fee which supports the development of the application. The fee works by mining into your pools for 98% of the time and mining into our pools for 2% of the time. In contrast, other similar services charge an upfront cost which we don't want to do.
