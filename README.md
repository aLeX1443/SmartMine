### Update:

We are working hard on SmartMine v0.5 which will bring a graphical user interface, a simplified setup process and many other great features. Look out for this release in the coming months!

SmartMine is a profit-switching mining application that allows you to mine coins directly using whatever pools you choose. If you would like to try it out, you can download it here: https://www.smartmine.org/

SmartMine allows you to mine 22 different coins directly (with support for more coins coming). Mining coins this way has consistently higher profitability over selling your hashing power with other similar services.

Head over to [WhatToMine](https://whattomine.com) and enter your hardware to see how much you would be making.

*Why do we stand out?*

SmartMine is able to detect when GPUs become inactive and restarts the mining program. This way, you'll have close to no down time on your mining.
Detailed statistics are displayed for each GPU with the ability to set which GPUs to mine with.


[SmartMine Ltd.](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11124585) is based in London, UK. We're a passionate group of developers who want to bring you the best mining application we can.

Mining with SmartMine means you have complete control of your funds, as everything you mine goes into your mining pools. You can either use our recommended pools, or use whichever ones you choose. Please refer to the Help section on our website for information on setting up mining pools.


### Features:

- SmartMine switches to the most profitable coin automatically
- You can choose any pool to mine into
- Modern GUI with Dark and Light themes to select from
- GPU temperatures, power consumption etc. are displayed
- SmartMine detects when the mining has stopped for whatever reason, and restarts it
- Profitability statistics are displayed in a selection of many fiat currencies
- Profitability takes the power cost per kWh into account
- Auto-start mining when SmartMine.exe is run
- Adjustable coin statistics refresh interval
- Adjustable % revenue to switch mining from one coin to another
- Comparatively low 2% fee (more details below)
- Detailed logging and analysis of all mining related data


### Features to come soon:

- Automatic algorithms benchmark (ETA: 1 week from this post)
- Temperature limit per GPU
- Estimated rewards obtained for each coin
- Estimates of total power consumption over time


### Features to come at a later date:

- Auto-conversion of mined coins into whatever coin you choose (the list of supported coins will be released when the feature is ready)
- Coin price and mining difficulty forecasting using Machine Learning. With this feature, SmartMine will attempt to predict which coins will be more valuable in the future, hence giving priority to those coins. You will also be able to manually modify these priority values. We hope that this feature will greatly improve your mining revenue.
- Linux support


Supported coins: ALTCOM, BTG, DCR, DGB, ETC, ETH, ETN, EXP, FTC, GRS, HUSH, KMD, LBC, MONA, SIB, TRZ, UBIQ, VIVO, VTC, ZCL, ZEC and ZEN (with more added periodically).

SmartMine operates with a 2% fee which supports the development of the application. The fee works by periodically mining into your pools for 98% of the time and mining into our pools for 2% of the time. The 'SmartMine Log' tab in the GUI shows when SmartMine is mining for the developers. You can check your pool dashboards to see your mining activity and compare it to what is shown in the 'SmartMine Log'. In contrast, other similar services charge an upfront cost which we don't want to do.
